Description:
Animal spontaneous behavior is influenced by a combination of genetics, environmental cues, and internal states, resulting in specific behavior patterns. However, traditional methods of evaluating animal spontaneous behavior and position preference to determine their level of locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior, such as the open-field test, only provide limited information. The postural changes, the dynamic kinematics of movements, and the spatiotemporal variation patterns of spontaneous behavior remain incompletely elucidated. Additionally, there is a lack of data-driven methods for studying spatial preferences in the square open field and comprehensive data on spontaneous behavior in male and female mice. Here, we utilized a posture-based machine learning-driven behavior analysis system to generate a highly reproducible and reliable atlas of spontaneous behaviors. This atlas includes high-dimensional patterns of spontaneous behavior, transition relationships between different movements, and sex-specific characteristics in spontaneous behavior patterns under different experimental conditions. We also presented a new method for studying spatial preferences in a square open field. Our findings reveal the characteristics of spontaneous behavior and provide empirical support for including both sexes in spontaneous behavior experiments. This is essential for furthering our knowledge of the neural mechanisms of cognition and behavior.
